<p style='text-align: justify;'>The goal of this project was to design and implement a computational system to automatically analyse Stravinskiâ€™s <em>The Rite of Spring</em>, in order to discover new possible points of view and supply the current deficiencies of the Music Computing common analysis systems.</p> 

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The analytical system is implemented as a collection of Python functions supported upon a MATLAB feature extraction environment (implemented with the MIDI toolbox).</p>
