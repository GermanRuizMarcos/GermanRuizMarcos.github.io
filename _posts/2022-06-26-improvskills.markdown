<p style='text-align: justify;'>The goal of this project was to investigate and identify a relationship between musical ability and creative musical thinking in free-improvisation by means of a digital instrument. To do so, I designed a novel computational musical instrument using Pure Data. I also designed a set of learning metrics where the technical skills are computed as the product of the spatial, frequential and cinematic analysis of each performance, weighting the final value according to its error, and the creative skills are computed as the product of the variables novelty, surprise and value.</p>
