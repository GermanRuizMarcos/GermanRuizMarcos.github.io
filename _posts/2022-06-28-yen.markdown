<p style='text-align: justify;'>I got a theme from a Disney film stuck in my head once. While humming it non-stop, a started to ask myself lots of questions:</p>

- How far can the theme be streched?
- What if it was sung by a traditional choir?
- Could the members of the choir sang questions and answers to each other, as if they were playing ping-pong with the music?
- Would it be possible to mimick timpani with human voices and would it make any sense?
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Well, <em>yen</em> is the answer to those questions. And that is not the craziest thing about <em>yen</em>. As strange as it seems, it ocurred to me that it'd be a good idea to write some lyrics. And so I did. I turned <em>yen</em> into a Christmas carol. I know. I was in a rebel mood. 

## Have a listen ;)
