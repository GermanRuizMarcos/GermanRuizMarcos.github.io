Did you that the term *IRINI* stands for peace in Greek? And do you know how the letters in the word *IRINI* sound when given in Morse code?

*fugued peace* is a little fugue, for piano, about peace. The fugue's subject is directly inspired by the sound the word *IRINI* makes in Morse code. I once was asked about the meaning of this piece of music. How would I describe it? Well, I guess it's like a musical speech in search of *irini*, spoken through counterpoint in contemporary times. 


## Have a listen ;)
